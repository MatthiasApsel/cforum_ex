TODO

- We should use "created_at" and "updated_at" instate of "date"
- We should have a Settings model in the database for stuff like forum title, welcome message, etc.
- We should write translations from the beginning, at least english and german
- make it possible to make a new thread
- we should have categories as a object in the database (or is it relational db thinking?)

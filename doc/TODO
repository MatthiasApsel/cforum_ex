TODO

- We should have a Settings model in the database for stuff like forum title, welcome message, etc.
  So you want settings in the database? /ck
  Yes so the admin can change them easily /jp

- we should have categories as a object in the database (or is it relational db thinking?)
  no, we shouldn't. Categories are free text, also with the current cforum. /ck
  So how do you get a list of categories? /jp


- We should write translations from the beginning, at least english and german
- make it possible to create a new thread

TODO

- Rename Thread.messages to Thread.message and it should no longer be an array

- We should use "created_at" and "updated_at" instate of "date"
  I don't think we need „updated_at“. Hm, well, maybe as a shortcut so we don't have to iterate over all messages /ck
  I think it would be good to indicate when the user changed the message the last time if she did /jp

- We should have a Settings model in the database for stuff like forum title, welcome message, etc.
  So you want settings in the database? /ck
  Yes so the admin can change them easily /jp

- we should have categories as a object in the database (or is it relational db thinking?)
  no, we shouldn't. Categories are free text, also with the current cforum. /ck
  So how do you get a list of categories? /jp


- We should write translations from the beginning, at least english and german
- make it possible to create a new thread

TODO

- we should have categories as a object in the database (or is it relational db thinking?)
  no, we shouldn't. Categories are free text, also with the current cforum. /ck
  So how do you get a list of categories? /jp

- make it possible to create a new thread

- use scope for archived/not archived instead of querying in the controller index

- use the form helpers instead of writing everything on your own

- some funky stuff is going on with the routes, I think we should fix it without the match
  lines, it fucks up everything which is good in rails, none of the helpers work anymore

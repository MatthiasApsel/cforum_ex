= Starting development

Before you can start what you will need is:
- ruby >= 1.9
- rails >= 3.1.x
- mongodb


== Config mongodb
You can find the db name, port and host in /config/database.yml 
For starters you will need at least one database in mongodb this would be cforum-development
but you should add a cforum-test database too if you want to contribute code and tests.



== Coning the repo
git clone ssh://cforum-git@painkiller.defunced.de/var/lib/git/cforum.git cforum
cd cforum
bundle install

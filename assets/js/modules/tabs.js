/**
 *  @module tabs
 *
 *
 *  @summary
 *
 *  Replaces internal navigation with a tab interface.
 *
 *
 *  @description
 *
 *  This module creates a tab interface from prepared content. In
 *  case there is a template element with the ID tablist, it will take
 *  this elements content to replace a fallback navigation, which is
 *  presumed to be the previous element sibling of the template. After
 *  replacing the navigation with the tablist and setting up the state,
 *  all but the first elements that are meant to be tabpanels are
 *  hidden. When one of the tabs is activated, the current content
 *  is hidden and the newly selected content is made visible.
 *
 *
 *  @todo
 *
 *  The biggest part of this module must be refactored, because
 *  there have been too many subsequent changes causing disarray,
 *  and ultimately a poor handling of control flow. Additionaly most
 *  of the logic related to keyboard control should not be part of
 *  this module, since it can be reused for other components, too.

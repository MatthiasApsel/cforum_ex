/**
 *  @module functional
 *
 *
 *  @summary
 *
 *  Provides functions to support functional programming.
 *
 *
 *  @description
 *
 *  The functions exported from this module can be seen as building
 *  blocks for the implementation of the application specific program
 *  logic. The majority of the functions defined in this module are
 *  higher order functions serving as operators for other functions.
 *  Use cases covered by the members of this module include for
 *  example function composition, partial function application,
 *  guards and combinators.
 *
 *
 *  With the sole exception of the so called define function, all
 *  functions that do have at least one required formal parameter are
 *  curried. That means, they can be invoked with less arguments than
 *  neccessary and in this case, a function will be returned, which
 *  takes the remaining arguments and then calls the curried function
 *  or returns another function to collect missing values. That
 *  also holds true for closures, which are returned from some
 *  of the exported functions.
 *
 *
 *  As a general rule, functions that invoke other functions passed
 *  in as arguments will call these functions with the function context
 *  they themselves have been initialized with. However, though this
 *  practice enables the functions on hand to be used in connection
 *  with object methods, this kind of usage should be avoided
 *  wherever possible.
 *
 *
 +  The reason for this advice is that a function that reaches out
 *  for a context object does lack the property of being referencially
 *  transparent, which essentially means, that the call to a function
 *  can be replaced by its result without changing the state of the
 *  program. Functions that only process their arguments and always
 *  return the same output for the same input are way easier to
 *  test, and also improve the readability of the code.

/**
 *  @function define
 *
 *
 *  @summary
 *
 *  Sets the length and name properties of a function.
 *
 *
 *  @description
 *
 *  Some higher order functions like curry require that a given
 *  function has a fixed arity, which is represented by the length
 *  property of function objects. In other cases specifying the number
 *  of arguments expected by a function is not technically needed,
 *  but it is a valueable information provided to the caller.
 *
 *
 *  For the same reason it can be desireable to assign an otherwise
 *  anonymous function a specific name. As an example, this name can be
 *  used by capable browsers to improve their debugging tools, such
 *  that it is displayed in a stack trace when an error occured.
 *
 *
 *  Because neither length nor name are writable by default, their
 *  values cannot be changed through simple assignment. Instead, both
 *  properties must be explicitly defined. As for consistency, this
 *  function only changes the value attribute of each property, so
 *  future changes will also need explicit definition.
 *
 *
 *  Please note that this function is not auto-curried, so calling
 *  it with less arguments than required will cause an exception to be
 *  thrown. Thatâ€™s because the curry function itself depends on this
 *  function. Maybe this can be changed in the future but until
 *  now, care must be taken in this regard.

 *  This function takes a target function and returns a guard,

 *  free, because cache lookups are a costy operation itself. So it
 *  is advisable to only use this function for operations that have
 *  a big impact on performance or are not called very often. In
 *  addition, it should be kept in mind that caching results like
 *  this is obviously no option if the target function is not

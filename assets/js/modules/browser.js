 *  Because some useful features are not supported by every
 *  platform we have to take into consideration, there is a need
 *  for checks. So this module contains functions that test if
 *  certain interfaces are available and can be used as intended.
 *  Those functions typically do not expect arguments and return
 *  a boolean value indicating the test result.

 *
 *  @description
 *
 *  There are several situations where referencing the localStorage
 *  object causes an exception to be thrown, so to avoid breaking the
 *  program one has to use try and catch. In some cases though, itâ€™s
 *  not the reference causing the error but the attempt to set an
 *  item. Therefore testing for existence is not enough here and
 *  we actually have to try to set and remove an item.

 *  that this test is only about the availability of the API and does

 *  @description
 *
 *  Checking for existance of the WebSocket object should be
 *  safe, but it looks like there are indeed circumstances where

 *  This test will only yield true if the standard interface is
